// loud SET before compaction ever runs — deriving from it would only smuggle
// an un-SETtable value past validateCompactionMemoryLimit (which checks the
// operator-set value BEFORE this derivation fills it in).

// pod previously budgeted 32 GB for the main process and 16 GB for each
// subprocess — but it is not a guarantee.
//
// It is tolerable because these are mostly SPILL THRESHOLDS rather than
// reservations: DuckDB allocates up to the limit only if a query needs it, and

// caps CPU but not memory this default now costs throughput; set the key.
