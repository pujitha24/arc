// Phase 4 leader forwarding: when a non-leader node needs to apply a Raft
// command (RegisterFile, DeleteFile), it forwards the command over the
// existing peer-protocol TCP connection to the current Raft leader, which
// applies it locally and returns success/error.
//
// This file holds the client-side (forwardApplyToLeader, called from any
// non-leader coordinator method that needs to write to Raft) and the
// server-side (handleForwardApply, dispatched from handlePeerConnection).
// Both sides use security.ComputeForwardHMAC / security.ValidateForwardHMAC
// which bind the command payload into the signed material, preventing
// on-wire command swapping even without TLS.
//
// Background and rationale: Phase 1 introduced the manifest with a
// silent-skip on non-leader writers (coordinator.go's RegisterFileInManifest
// would return nil rather than error if the writer wasn't currently the
// leader). That's a latent data-loss bug — the writer's flush succeeds,
// the file lands in storage, but no Raft entry is appended and no peer
// learns about it. Phase 4 surfaced the same bug from a different angle
// because the compactor is typically NOT the Raft leader, so its
// CompactionBridge would always silently skip and the watcher would
// retry forever.
//
// The fix is leader forwarding — uniform across all callers. Both
// RegisterFileInManifest and DeleteFileFromManifest now call
// forwardApplyToLeader on non-leader nodes instead of silently dropping
// the command. The CompactionBridge uses these methods unchanged, so the
// fix is transparent to it.
