// Package filereplication implements peer-to-peer Parquet file replication
// for Arc Enterprise clusters without shared storage. It is the byte-level
// counterpart to Phase 1's cluster-wide file manifest: when a new file is
// announced on the Raft log, the puller downloads the bytes from the origin
// peer over the coordinator TCP protocol, verifies the SHA-256, and writes
// the file to the local storage backend.
//
// The puller is gated by the Enterprise license (FeatureClustering) and
// wired by the coordinator when cluster.replication_enabled is true.

// no peer can serve don't require a process restart to clear the gate.
// Periodic reconciliation cannot create or remove startup tags, and its
// failures cannot reopen readiness, but its successful pulls can heal
